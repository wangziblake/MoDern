# MoDern: A Sparse Model-inspired Deep Thresholding Network for Exponential Signal Reconstruction—Application in Fast Biological Spectroscopy
MoDern is a reliable, widely-available, ultra-fast, and easy-to-use technique for highly accelerated NMR. This work develops the first cloud-based artificial intelligence platform (XCloud-MoDern) for multi-dimensional NMR data processing, and is the proof-of-concept demonstration of the effectiveness of merging optimization, deep learning, and cloud computing.

## XCloud-MoDern: an artificial intelligence cloud platform
XCloud-MoDern is an easy-to-use cloud computing platform for processing of non-uniformly sampled (NUS) multi-dimensional NMR spectra online.
Up to now, XCloud-MoDern uses model-inspired deep learning (MoDern) to fast recover high-quality multi-dimensional spectra from NUS data.
The platform also provides a customized retrospectively undersampling technique (NUS simulator) to produce NUS data and the corresponding NUS mask from the fully sampled NMR data.

Now, XCloud-MoDern is available at: http://36.138.17.102:8989/, and we will continue to improve the using feeling.

Details on the instructions of XCloud-MoDern are described in its Manual, you can download "Manual_XCloud-MoDern.pdf" here (old version) or on our cloud platform (latest version). 

We also have provided some demo data and scripts on the cloud for the quick try, you can download "Demo_data_scripts_XCloud-MoDern.zip" here (old version) or on our cloud platform (latest version).

Hope you enjoy the reliable, efficient, and high-performance experience. If you find any questions in using XCloud-MoDern, please email me at wangzi1023@stu.xmu.edu.cn.
